# Sheldrake
Sheldrake (“duck” in Modern English) is a C++ toolbox that aims to interactively apply control policies written and simulated with [Drake](https://drake.mit.edu/) to embeeded systems. In other words, it is a *shell* for *Drake*.

This is currently a proof-of-concept and only applies PID and LQR models.
